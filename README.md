I used Python to create front-end and back-end of book store website and SQLITE for storing data and bootstrap for styling. 
<br/>
To run the program, it needs to install some packages in "requirements.txt".
<br/>
If use Pycharm IDE, automatically ask you to install packages in requirements.txt file. 
<br/>
Or you can install these packages using command line: open terminal window and run this command: 
<br/>
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
